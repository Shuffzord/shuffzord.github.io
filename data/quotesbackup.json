Compounding in business relationships is very important. Look at some of the top roles in society, like why someone is a CEO of a public company or managing billions of dollars. It\u2019s because people trust them. They are trusted because the relationships they\u2019ve built and the work they\u2019ve done has compounded. They\u2019ve stuck with the business and shown themselves (in a visible and accountable way) to be high-integrity people. Compound interest also happens in your reputation. If you have a sterling reputation and you keep building it for decades upon decades, people will notice. Your reputation will literally end up being thousands or tens of thousands of times more valuable than somebody else who was very talented but is not keeping the compound interest in reputation going.",

For example, when you buy something in a store on a credit card, you essentially do so by saying, \u201CI promise to pay.\u201D Together you and the store owner create a credit asset and a credit liability. So where do you take the money from? Nowhere. You created credit. It goes away in the same way. Suppose the store owner rightly believes that you and others won\u2019t pay the credit card company and that the credit card company won\u2019t pay him. Then he correctly believes that the credit \u201Casset\u201D he has isn\u2019t really there. It didn\u2019t go somewhere else; it\u2019s simply gone. As this implies, a big part of the deleveraging process is people discovering that much of what they thought of as their wealth was merely people\u2019s promises to give them money. Now that those promises aren\u2019t being kept, that wealth no longer exists. When",

Basically, for copyright reasons, many publishers set limitations on how much of a book you can export through highlights. For example, if you highlight more than 10% of many books, those highlights above the limit will be truncated with a \u0022...\u0022. We understand how incredibly frustrating this can be because often the books we highlight the most are the ones we most want to post-process! Unfortunately, we have no way around this limit at this time.",

        "Text": "Readwise helps you remember more of what you read using two principles borrowed from cognitive science: [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) and [active recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_recall). Active recall (also known as quizzing, testing, or retrieval) is the process by which we challenge our minds to retrieve a piece of information. Simply rereading a passage from time to time, on the other hand, is passive. Rereading is no doubt better than never revisiting the passage, but research has repeatedly shown that active recall is significantly more effective. So how can you take advantage of active recall in Readwise? For any highlight that you wish to deliberately commit to memory, hit the Master icon in the web app (keyboard shortcut m). You can then convert that highlight from a passive passage to be reread to a flashcard to be actively recalled. In turn, you\u0027ll retain vastly more of what you read.",

        "Text": "When you start using Readwise, its proprietary [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) algorithm assumes by default that each of your highlights is of equal quality, equal relevance, and equal difficulty. For most people, this is not entirely true. Some highlights are better than average; some are below. Some highlights are especially relevant right now; some not so much. Some highlights are hard to remember; some are easy.\n\nYou can take control of this algorithm by supplying feedback in the web app. If a highlight is better than average, especially relevant, or difficult, instruct Readwise \u0022More\u0022 (keyboard shortcut 2). You\u0027ll see this highlight more often than average. If a highlight is in the middle, instruct Readwise \u0022Later\u0022 (keyboard shortcut 3). You get the idea. If you consistently supply feedback, you\u0027ll watch the quality of your reviews steadily improve. In turn, you\u0027ll retain significantly more of what you read.",

We intensely learn about a single subject for a few weeks. Then we move onto the next book. Readwise uses your highlights from to space out each book you\u0027ve read into perpetuity.

For the same reasons that founders should reduce churn in a SaaS business before investing in growth; or investors should buffer their portfolios against losses before seeking gains; or bodybuilders should prevent muscle loss before adding lean mass. No matter what you\u2019re doing, the best way to grow is to first prevent losses.\n\nThink of it this way: If you\u0027ve got a leaky bucket, you\u0027re better off fixing the leak before pouring water in the top. For those of you who prefer numbers: If you start with a portfolio worth $100 and lose 50%, you now need to earn 100% to breakeven.\nThis principle, of course, also extends to learning.",

It began in 2016 when [Tristan Homsi](https://twitter.com/homsiT) and [Daniel Doyon](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion) connected through an obscure comment about reading lists on Hacker News and subsequently bonded over a mutual interest in so-called \u0022reading tech\u0022. One thing led to another and they decided to collaborate on an MVP, which launched in May 2017. Readwise has organically evolved ever since.",
