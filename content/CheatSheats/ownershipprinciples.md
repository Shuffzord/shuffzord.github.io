1. Everything needs an owner
2. The owner doesn't have to be the task executor
3. Ownership can change (but must be notified to the team)
4. The owner can have assistants but there is only one owner
5. Ownership must be actively accepted by the owner - you can't assign ownership without their knowledge
6. The owner should actively communicate any changes, progress, or issues to the team and stakeholders
7. If the owner delegates tasks, they should ensure the delegate understands their responsibilities and has the necessary resources to fulfill them
