Recently, I spent a lot of time on "vibe coding"‚Äîusing AI agents to create software. I'd like to share a project I worked on: www.smarter-loan.com.

Project assumptions:

- Minimal self-coding: Less than 5% of the code was written by me (even the content is mostly AI-generated!).
- Diverse tools üõ†Ô∏è: I learned that different models excel at different tasks:
  - Replit: UI
  - Roo Code with Claude: architectural and mathematical aspects
  - Gemini: "grunt work"
- Reasonable level of difficulty: A project that would normally require serious thought about architecture and business domain. The project involves a lot of math, and I'll note upfront‚Äîif you know someone in the financial industry, I'd love to verify my data with more powerful banking models! I'd appreciate sharing this post.
- Real value: Loan calculators can save people a lot of money.

What does the calculator offer? üìä
- Detailed amortization schedule with breakdowns of principal and interest payments
- Overpayment simulations with testing of various strategies
- Data export to spreadsheets
- Side-by-side comparison of loan scenarios
- Clear, intuitive interface
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The app is still in beta, so bugs may occur. I'd love to receive any feedback‚Äîevery comment will help improve the tool!

Time and costs üí∞
Project: one week of work + ~$60 for AI agents. Traditionally? About 50x higher cost!

Do agents replace programmers?
Yes and no üòä It's definitely worth spending time deeply thinking‚Äîalone or with an agent‚Äîabout what we actually want to achieve and preparing at least a draft architecture beforehand.
Creation ‚Üí easy
Refactoring ‚Üí hard
At the current stage, a technical person is needed, but with good requirements and feedback, agents will be able to write such a calculator in a few hours. When? Sooner than people think.

What's next? üîÆ
I'll continue developing the project, but I also have other parallel projects. Would you like to help or learn more? Write to me!
Or maybe you have an idea to implement but lack experience or are hesitant to work with AI agents? Write to me as well! I'd be happy to share my experience and support.
