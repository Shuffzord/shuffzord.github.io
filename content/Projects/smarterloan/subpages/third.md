Hi LinkedIn!
This is the third micro post about the Smarter-Loan project https://lnkd.in/d9R2R6-jâ€”this time a few words about stability and what's new in the vibe coding world of Smarter Loan.

What has changed since last week?
1. âœ¨ System stability: This was the key topic of recent days. My goal was to eliminate all random errors in calculations and UI that could surprise at the least expected moment. What helped?
   a) ðŸ§® MCP Calculator: I used a ready-made MCP calculator server so that AI could analyze test values and independently generate correct calculations. This secured the project against edge cases (screenshot below).
   b) ðŸ¤– Automated tests with Puppeteer: First on MCP, then across the entire system. Automation in action = fewer bugs, more peace of mind (screenshot below for reference).

Was it easy to reach this stage? Let's say the road wasn't paved. A non-technical person would probably stumble more than once. But with a bit of understanding, well-written prompts (for me, only Claude 3.7 is reliable)â€”it can be managed.
2. ðŸš€ Overpayment optimizer: I'm already working on a new featureâ€”the overpayment optimizer. The first seeds are already online. Check out the site and see what's happening. Feedback is welcome!


PS. Thanks for shares, comments, and every message. It really drives the project. Cheers!
