The checklist is not prioritized in any way and all elements should he threated as parts of a complex system.

# Risk

Risk-All investment evaluations should begin by measuring risk, especially reputational.

- Incorporate an appropriate margin of safety
- Avoid dealing with people of questionable character
- Insist upon proper compensation for risk assumed
- Always beware of inflation and interest rate exposures
- avoid big mistakes; shun permanent capital loss

# Independece

Only in fairy tales are emperors told to be naked

- Objectivity and rationality require independence of though
- Remember that just because other people agree or disagree with you doesn't make you right or wrong-the only thing that matters is the correctness of your analysis and judgement
- Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean (merely average performance)

# Preparation

The only way to win is to work, work, work, work, and hope to have a few insights.

- Develop into a lifelong self-learner though voracious reading; cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day
- More important that the will to win is the will to prepare
- Develop fluency in mental models from the major academic disciplines
- If you want to get smart, the question you have to keep asking is "why, why why".

# Intelectual humulity

Acknowledging what you don't know is the dawning of wisdom

- Stay withing a well-defined circle of competence
- Identify and reconcile disconfirming evidence
- Resist the craving for false precision, false certainties, etc
- Above all, never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person to fool

# Analytic rigor

Use scientific method and effective checklists minimizes error and omissions

- Determine value apart from price; progress apart from activity; wealth apart from size.
- It is better to remember the obvious than to grasp the esoteric
- Be a business analyst, not a market, macroeconomic, or security analyst
- Consider totality of risk and effect; look always at potential second order and higher level impacts
- Think forwards and backwards-Invert, always invert

# Allocation

Proper allocation of capital is an investor's number one job

- Remember that highest and the best use is always measured by the next best use (opportunity cost)
- Good ideas are rare when the odds are greatly in your favor, best (allocate) heavity
- Don't fall in love with an investment-be situation - dependent and opportunity driven

# Patience

Resist the natural human bias to act

- Compound interest is the eight wonder of the world; never interrupt it unnecessarily
- Avoid unnecessary transactional taxes and frictional costs; never take action for its own sake
- Be alert for the arrival of luck

Enjoy the process along with the proceeds, because the process is where you live

# Decisiveness

When proper circumstances present themselves, act with decisiveness and conviction

- Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful
- Opportunity doesn't come often, so seize it when it does
- Opportunity meeeting the prepared mind: that's the game

# Change

Live with change and accept unremovable complexity

- Recognize and adapt to the true nature of the world around you; don't expect it to adapt to you
- Continually challenge and willingly amend your "best loved ideas"
- Recognize reality even when you don't like it, especially when you don't like it

# Focus

Keep things simple and remember what you set out to do

- Remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets and can be lost in a heartbeat
- Guard against the effects of hubris and boredom
- Don't overlook the obvious by drowning in the minutiae
- Be careful to exclude unneeded information or slop: "A small leak can sink a great ship"
- Face your big troubles; don't sweep them under the rug
