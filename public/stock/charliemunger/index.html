                <p>The checklist is not prioritized in any way and all elements should he threated as parts of a complex system.</p>
<h1 id="risk">Risk</h1>
<p>Risk-All investment evaluations should begin by measuring risk, especially reputational.</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporate an appropriate margin of safety</li>
<li>Avoid dealing with people of questionable character</li>
<li>Insist upon proper compensation for risk assumed</li>
<li>Always beware of inflation and interest rate exposures</li>
<li>avoid big mistakes; shun permanent capital loss</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="independece">Independece</h1>
<p>Only in fairy tales are emperors told to be naked</p>
<ul>
<li>Objectivity and rationality require independence of though</li>
<li>Remember that just because other people agree or disagree with you doesn&rsquo;t make you right or wrong-the only thing that matters is the correctness of your analysis and judgement</li>
<li>Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean (merely average performance)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="preparation">Preparation</h1>
<p>The only way to win is to work, work, work, work, and hope to have a few insights.</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop into a lifelong self-learner though voracious reading; cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day</li>
<li>More important that the will to win is the will to prepare</li>
<li>Develop fluency in mental models from the major academic disciplines</li>
<li>If you want to get smart, the question you have to keep asking is &ldquo;why, why why&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="intelectual-humulity">Intelectual humulity</h1>
<p>Acknowledging what you don&rsquo;t know is the dawning of wisdom</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay withing a well-defined circle of competence</li>
<li>Identify and reconcile disconfirming evidence</li>
<li>Resist the craving for false precision, false certainties, etc</li>
<li>Above all, never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person to fool</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="analytic-rigor">Analytic rigor</h1>
<p>Use scientific method and effective checklists minimizes error and omissions</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine value apart from price; progress apart from activity; wealth apart from size.</li>
<li>It is better to remember the obvious than to grasp the esoteric</li>
<li>Be a business analyst, not a market, macroeconomic, or security analyst</li>
<li>Consider totality of risk and effect; look always at potential second order and higher level impacts</li>
<li>Think forwards and backwards-Invert, always invert</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="allocation">Allocation</h1>
<p>Proper allocation of capital is an investor&rsquo;s number one job</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that highest and the best use is always measured by the next best use (opportunity cost)</li>
<li>Good ideas are rare when the odds are greatly in your favor, best (allocate) heavity</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t fall in love with an investment-be situation - dependent and opportunity driven</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="patience">Patience</h1>
<p>Resist the natural human bias to act</p>
<ul>
<li>Compound interest is the eight wonder of the world; never interrupt it unnecessarily</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary transactional taxes and frictional costs; never take action for its own sake</li>
<li>Be alert for the arrival of luck</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy the process along with the proceeds, because the process is where you live</p>
<h1 id="decisiveness">Decisiveness</h1>
<p>When proper circumstances present themselves, act with decisiveness and conviction</p>
<ul>
<li>Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful</li>
<li>Opportunity doesn&rsquo;t come often, so seize it when it does</li>
<li>Opportunity meeeting the prepared mind: that&rsquo;s the game</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="change">Change</h1>
<p>Live with change and accept unremovable complexity</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognize and adapt to the true nature of the world around you; don&rsquo;t expect it to adapt to you</li>
<li>Continually challenge and willingly amend your &ldquo;best loved ideas&rdquo;</li>
<li>Recognize reality even when you don&rsquo;t like it, especially when you don&rsquo;t like it</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="focus">Focus</h1>
<p>Keep things simple and remember what you set out to do</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets and can be lost in a heartbeat</li>
<li>Guard against the effects of hubris and boredom</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t overlook the obvious by drowning in the minutiae</li>
<li>Be careful to exclude unneeded information or slop: &ldquo;A small leak can sink a great ship&rdquo;</li>
<li>Face your big troubles; don&rsquo;t sweep them under the rug</li>
</ul>
