            <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span> Compound interest is a very
            powerful concept. Compound interest applies to more than just
            compounding capital. Compounding capital is just the beginning.
            Compounding in business relationships is very important. Look at
            some of the top roles in society, like why someone is a CEO of a
            public company or managing billions of dollars. It’s because people
            trust them. They are trusted because the relationships they’ve built
            and the work they’ve done has compounded. They’ve stuck with the
            business and shown themselves (in a visible and accountable way) to
            be high-integrity people. Compound interest also happens in your
            reputation. If you have a sterling reputation and you keep building
            it for decades upon decades, people will notice. Your reputation
            will literally end up being thousands or tens of thousands of times
            more valuable than somebody else who was very talented but is not
            keeping the compound interest in reputation going.

            your best work. Even if you’re just trying to make money, you will
            actually be the most successful.

            <span></span> Among all these social improvements, one in particular
            is found to significantly reduce family size–the empowerment of
            women.44 Wherever women have the vote, wherever girls stay in school
            for longer, wherever women are in charge of their own lives and not
            dictated to by men, wherever they have access to good healthcare and
            contraception, wherever they are free to take any job and their
            aspirations for life are raised, the birth rate falls. The reason
            for this is straightforward–empowerment brings freedom of choice and
            when life offers more options for women, their choice is often to
            have fewer children. The faster and more fully women are empowered,
            the quicker a nation will move through Stage 3 and on to Stage 4.

            A przecież oni mają gdzie je wyrzucić. A wszechnatura nie ma takiego
            miejsca poza sobą. Ale to dziwne w tej jej sztuce, że sama się
            w sobie ogranicza, a wszystko, co wewnątrz niej zdaje się psuć,
            starzeć i nie przedstawiać żadnego pożytku, przemienia w siebie samą
            i stwarza z tego właśnie inne rzeczy nowe. A nie czuje potrzeby
            żadnego materiału z zewnątrz, ani miejsca, dokąd by odrzucała to, co
            zbyt zepsute. Wystarcza więc jej i miejsce, które do niej należy,
            i tworzywo, które jest jej własnością, i sztuka jej właściwa.

            <span></span> Most of what people think is money is really credit,
            and credit does appear out of thin air during good times and then
            disappear at bad times. For example, when you buy something in a
            store on a credit card, you essentially do so by saying, “I promise
            to pay.” Together you and the store owner create a credit asset and
            a credit liability. So where do you take the money from? Nowhere.
            You created credit. It goes away in the same way. Suppose the store
            owner rightly believes that you and others won’t pay the credit card
            company and that the credit card company won’t pay him. Then he
            correctly believes that the credit “asset” he has isn’t really
            there. It didn’t go somewhere else; it’s simply gone. As this
            implies, a big part of the deleveraging process is people
            discovering that much of what they thought of as their wealth was
            merely people’s promises to give them money. Now that those promises
            aren’t being kept, that wealth no longer exists. When

            <span></span> If you're an avid highlighter of Kindle books, you've
            probably encountered the Kindle highlight limit. Basically, for
            copyright reasons, many publishers set limitations on how much of a
            book you can export through highlights. For example, if you
            highlight more than 10% of many books, those highlights above the
            limit will be truncated with a "...". We understand how incredibly
            frustrating this can be because often the books we highlight the
            most are the ones we most want to post-process! Unfortunately, we
            have no way around this limit at this time.

            [Books](https://readwise.io/library) menu as well. Note that if you

            fluff-filled paragraph even though all you really wanted were the
            key sentences at the beginning and end? You can cut this fluff by
            taking special notes while you read. These notes instruct Readwise
            to combine multiple, non-adjacent highlights into a single
            annotation. Simply highlight the first string of text you want to
            combine and add the note .c1 ("c" for "concatenate"). Then,
            highlight the second string of text and add the note .c2. Upon
            importing into Readwise, these two highlights will be combined into
            a single annotation. Read more here: [How to Combine Highlights

            <span></span> Did you know you can add chapters to your highlights
            in Readwise? In addition, you can generate a nifty table of contents
            which you can use to quickly navigate a book and refresh your memory
            of the book's organization. You add this chapter data by taking a
            special note while you read. Simply highlight the title of each
            section and add a note beginning with a period (.) followed by an h
            (for "heading") and then the number 1 through 3 representing the
            section's position in the hierarchy. For example, with a book
            organized into parts, chapters, and sections, you would denote all
            parts as .h1, all chapters as .h2, and all sections as .h3. Read

            <span></span> Do you ever wish that your highlights were tagged with
            useful keywords and categories, but never bothered because the
            process of tagging is just too cumbersome? There's an easy way to
            tag your highlights, found only in Readwise called, inline tagging.
            An inline tag is a special note taken while you read that's
            automatically converted into a tag in Readwise. Tagging in the
            moment is much faster than tagging after the fact, and once your
            highlights have keywords and categories, they're much easier to
            review and reference. Simply highlight a passage and add a note
            beginning with a period (.) followed by a single word or
            abbreviation (with no spaces). You can also train Readwise to
            interpret shorthand! Read more here: [How to Tag Your Highlights
            While You

            <span></span> COMING SOON! In addition to the general purpose
            methods for mastering a passive highlight in Readwise (cloze
            deletion and question & answer), there's also a special active
            recall method called term. If you pay attention, much of any
            nonfiction book is spent "coming to terms" in which the author
            carefully explains what he or she means by specific words. Sometimes
            authors even introduces new terms. For example, the term antifragile
            in Nassim Taleb's Antifragile. If you master the terms in a
            nonfiction book, your understanding will skyrocket compared to a
            passive reading. To convert a highlight to a term, hit the Master
            icon in the web app (keyboard shortcut m).

            <span></span> Readwise offers increasing degrees of active recall
            intensity (Mastery). The least demanding is a deceptively simple
            technique called [cloze
            deletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test), more commonly
            known as "fill in the blank". With cloze deletion, a salient keyword
            is hidden from the passage, giving you an opportunity to pause and
            actively recall the missing information. This might sound trivial,
            but the simple act forces you to focus on the surrounding context
            and search your mind. This effort, in turn, is scientifically proven
            to form stronger memories enabling you to retain profoundly more of
            what you've read. To apply cloze deletion to a highlight, hit the
            Master icon in the web app (keyboard shortcut m).

            active recall is significantly more effective. So how can you take
            advantage of active recall in Readwise? For any highlight that you

            same reasons that founders should reduce churn in a SaaS business
            before investing in growth; or investors should buffer their
            portfolios against losses before seeking gains; or bodybuilders
            should prevent muscle loss before adding lean mass. No matter what
            you’re doing, the best way to grow is to first prevent losses. Think
            of it this way: If you've got a leaky bucket, you're better off
            fixing the leak before pouring water in the top. For those of you
            who prefer numbers: If you start with a portfolio worth $100 and
            lose 50%, you now need to earn 100% to breakeven. This principle, of

            <span></span> It's not uncommon for a Readwise user to have more
            than 10,000 highlights in his or her catalog. If this user reviews
            10 highlights per Daily Readwise, it'd take nearly three years to go
            through them all (assuming no new highlights during that time!).
            Because of this, we've built a "resurfacing algorithm" which tries
            to show you the "right highlight at the right time" kind of like
            Spotify trying to serve up daily mixes based on your listening
            history. The Readwise algorithm also enables you to take control and
            manually "tune" many of its settings. You can do this by selecting
            the [Preferences](https://readwise.io/preferences) menu from the
            [Readwise Dashboard](https://readwise.io/dashboard) and toggling the

            <span></span> One of the nice things about having all your
            highlights synchronized in a single repository is that it's easy to
            retrieve the excerpt you're looking for. You can hunt for a
            particular highlight by browsing the particular
            [Book](https://readwise.io/library) or
            [Article](https://readwise.io/articles), by using your
            [Tags](https://readwise.io/tags), or, of course, by using good old
            fashioned search. A search box is displayed in the upper right
            corner of most Readwise screens. Alternatively, you can go to the
            [Search](https://readwise.io/search) page to query your entire
            Readwise catalog.

            them all here, but almost all shortcuts are discoverable if you
            hover over an action in the web app.

            <span></span> The first time you see a highlight resurfaced in
            Readwise, it will have a blue dot in the upper left corner. This
            indicates that the highlight is still "unprocessed" similar to an
            unread email. Once you read the highlight or perform an action, the
            highlight will then be considered "processed". This is helpful for
            readers wishing to systematically review all their highlights,
            either in whole or for particular books. You can also mouseover the
            dot to see additional data, such as when you originally took the
            highlight.

            <span></span> Let's be honest: Many of our highlights are not so
            good. Maybe we highlighted a fragment because of Kindle's annoying
            refresh rate. Maybe we highlighted a passage that made sense in the
            moment, but makes no sense now. Either way, if Readwise resurfaces a
            highlight that's unlikely to have any future value to you, you
            should "discard" it. You discard in the Readwise Email by clicking
            the Discard link underneath each highlight. You discard in the

            <span></span> Any time you highlight a Kindle book purchased
            directly from Amazon, that highlight will be synchronized in the
            Amazon cloud (provided your device is connected to the internet).
            The Readwise browser extension retrieves those highlights and saves
            them in your Readwise account. So long as you use Chrome or Firefox
            with the Readwise extension installed, Readwise will continuously
            synchronize with Amazon in the background. If you don't use Chrome
            or Firefox with the Readwise extension, you'll need to manually
            resync your Kindle highlights from time to time.

            <span></span> Some people ask us why we've decided to bootstrap
            Readwise through revenues rather than raise venture capital. It's a
            complicated answer to a complicated question, but long story short,
            we concluded that bootstrapping would better enable us to focus on
            our small niche market of "nonfiction power readers" rather than
            casual readers. You can read more about this decision here: [Why
            We're Bootstrapping

            <span></span> Many people ask us about how Readwise got started. It
            began in 2016 when [Tristan Homsi](https://twitter.com/homsiT) and
            [Daniel Doyon](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion) connected through
            an obscure comment about reading lists on Hacker News and
            subsequently bonded over a mutual interest in so-called "reading
            tech". One thing led to another and they decided to collaborate on
            an MVP, which launched in May 2017. Readwise has organically evolved
            ever since.

            Among other things, the mobile app enables you to "highlight"
            physical books using your phone's camera (OCR). On iOS, you can also
            install a widget that rotates different highlights on your home
            screen throughout the day. You can find links to each platform here:

            <span></span> A key reason the long-term debt cycle can be sustained
            for so long is that central banks progressively lower interest
            rates, which raises asset prices and, in turn, people’s wealth,
            because of the present value effect that lowering interest rates has
            on asset prices.

            something major happened. A group of new beings emerged from the
